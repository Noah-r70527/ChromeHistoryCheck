# BrowserHistoryParser

This script takes a browser history file (i.e. Edge, Chrome) as input and outputs a directory with csv files for each of the tables contained in the Chrome history file.

You have two options when running: 
- Supply the input file as an argument with -f
- Input the file after being prompted if the -f argument is not present.


**Example:**
-----------------------------

**python ChromeHistoryCheck.py -f History** (File name supplied as the -f argument)


**python ChromeHistoryCheck.py** (No arguments)

_Enter the input file:_
_History_
